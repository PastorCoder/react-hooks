useRef is used to access the dom elements jsut like document.getEleementById.

* UseLayoutEffect is almost the same with useEffect.
   - UseLayoutEffect renders before useEffect
   - useEffect is called after everything is rendered on page while useLayerEffect is printed before the page renders.

* forwardRef allows you to transform a component to accept a ref. we do this by wrapping the whole component with forwardRef()
* The problem that useCallback hook solves is similar to the problem that useMemo hook solves.
* we store functions and not just data in useCallback()
* useMemo and useCallback is used to prevent things from re-rendering everytime there's a change in state
